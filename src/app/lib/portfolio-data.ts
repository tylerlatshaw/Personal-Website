I was able to present my experience at the 50th annual National Collegiate Honors Council conference alongside co-presenters Phillip Belder, DMD and Kyle Kopko, PhD, JD. <br/><br/>Abstract: The Elizabethtown College Honors Program has been an incubator for innovative education since its inception. Now in its 16th year of existence, the program is transitioning to its third Honors Director, who is also a graduate of the Elizabethtown College Honors Program. This panel discussion will explain how the program effectively transitioned from one director to the next, implemented a new strategic plan, all while incorporating student perspectives in the transition process. As a result of this process, the Program was restructured in a way to ensure that students had more pathways to completion and engagement, despite decreases in the Program's budget. Special emphasis will be placed on the vital job the student honors council played in the success of the transition.",
