            <p className="py-2"><em><strong>In Short:</strong>&nbsp;Some information - such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics - is collected automatically when you visit the website.</em></p>
            <p className="py-2">I automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the website. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information unless you provide it) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use the website, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of the website, and for internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
            <p className="py-2">Like many websites, I also collect information through cookies and similar technologies. </p>
            <p className="py-2">The information I collect includes:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
                <li><em>Log and Usage Data.</em> Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information my servers automatically collect when you access or use the website and which I record in log files. Depending on how you interact with the website, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity on the website (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called &quot;crash dumps&quot;), and hardware settings).</li>
                <li><em>Device Data.</em> I collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the website. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.</li>
                <li><em>Location Data.</em> I collect location data such as information about your device&apos;s location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information I collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the website. For example, I may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells me your general location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing me to collect this information either by disabling your location setting on your device.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold mt-8" id="infouse">2. HOW DO I USE YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

                <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold mt-8" id="infosafe">6. HOW DO I KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
                <p className="py-2"><em><strong>In Short:</strong>&nbsp;I aim to protect your personal information through a system of technical security measures.</em></p>
                <p className="py-2">I have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information I process. However, despite my safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so I cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat my security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although I will do my best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from the website is at your own risk. You should only access the website within a secure environment.</p>

By using the website, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent&apos;s use of the website. If I learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, I will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from my records.

                <p id="cookienotice" className="mt-4"><strong>Cookies and similar technologies.</strong> Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies.

                <p className="py-2">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, I do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that I must follow in the future, I will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
